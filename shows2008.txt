But it was fun to finally see this show.  It's kind of different to not know what's going to happen next when watching Shakespeare.  John Pribyl (Marc Antony) was excellent.

No particularly stellar performances, but excellent timing (which is key in this show) throughout.

Edward Albee	Timothy Bond	Angus Bowmer Theatre	-1(-)9(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)9(-)-1(-)-1(-)9(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)9	(-)I love these family-in-a-room-discussing-and-fighting dramas, and this one is a gem of the genre. The guy who played George was my fave, and the younger guy was my least fave -- especially the moment when he unconvincingly cried after the climactic moment of the play. But for him this would have been a ten.  Of any of the plays, I think this yielded the most post-show conversation.(-)(-)(-)(-)I was on the edge of my seat. The only thing that kept it from being a ten was Nick.(-)(-)(-)Wicked fun. Nick wasn't always believable. Tour de force from George and Martha. Well filled-out Honey (especially for such a skinny woman).(-)(-)(-)(-)Abstruse.

12	The Winter's Tale	William Shakespeare	Michael Donald Edwards	Elizabethan Theatre	-1(-)7(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)7(-)-1(-)-1(-)7(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)7	(-)I thought the overt 60's theme of the second half was surprising given the relatively subtle placement of the first half in the 50's.  The &quot;tragic&quot; first half is, I think, hard to pull off because, like most tragedies, the main characters flaw is so unbelievable on the face of it. But there were some definitely fine moments, and the Summer of Love scenes were definitely fun. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)Beautiful and touching statue scene. Fun Ray Porter entrance from the trapdoor. Hot hippy flower-girl Tyler Layton. A little over the top on the 60's stuff. It feels a little like two different plays between the first and second acts.(-)(-)(-)(-)

12	Macbeth	William Shakespeare	Libby Appel	New Theatre	-1(-)8(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)9(-)-1(-)-1(-)7(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)8	(-)A very bloody Macbeth, with a very small cast of four women and two men. The understudy did not detract; indeed, there were no overtly poor performances that pulled me out of the story. Lady Macbeth was played by last year's Cassandra with much of the same fervor. It gets an eight mostly for an above-average performance, cool directoral choices, and an (obviously) incredible script.(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)Very cool theatricality, but not much drama. Too much estrogen.(-)(-)(-)(-)Panty line.

The acting was reasonable but unremarkable.  The production was probably a 5 or 6, but the show is already fading from memory.(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)Fine acting in kinda boring play. Some nice moments, but I felt like this was yet another affirmative action play. It was a slice of life, but I didn't really care.(-)(-)(-)(-)

Overall, the modernization may have made it easier to understand what was going on, but it made it more difficult to believe or understand the characters. Good Robin Goodrin Nordli as Hedda. Tessman (Jeffrey King) tried too hard to be foolish, stupid and, ya know, modern. He bugged. Aunt Julie (Eileen Desandre) was solid as always.

14	Much Ado About Nothing	William Shakespeare	Laird Williamson	Elizabethan	-1(-)6(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)7(-)-1(-)6(-)-1(-)6	(-)Beatrice and Benedick were good.  This one was set in the 30s, Spanish civil war.  Dumb dance scene with clowns.<br />(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)I completely agree with Scot, but I think B&amp;B were fab enough to warrant an extra half-point, which rounds up to a 7. I think the problems might be inherent in the play -- I've never seen a production where I liked the young lovers or Don John. Claudio was particularly passionless and disappointing in the accusation scene. Dogberry was alright, but I feel like I've seen better.(-)(-)Beatrice and Benedick were fab, but little else was in this morally anachronistic scary clown tale. Don John was far too fey, and frankly the flamenco fantasia was forced. (-)(-)Robin Nordli delivered a feisty Beatrice, and Brent Harris (from Present Laughter in 2003) nails the swagger and wit of Benedick.  Lowpoints included lackluster performances by Claudio, Don John and several un-funny clowns and balloon-bearing harlequins in silk pyjamas.
14	The Comedy of Errors	William Shakespeare	Bill Rauch	Bowmer	-1(-)9(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)9(-)-1(-)9(-)-1(-)9	(-)Vegas in the late 50s, early 60s.  Awesome Godfather opening.  Fab fab set. Consistently funny throughout, though Ray Porters Antipholus was at times over the top. Cool that both sets of twins were played by single actors.(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)Twintastic! They even managed to make the opening monologue interesting. Ray Porter was comic genius, as usual, and the Dromio was damn funny, if a little over the top on occassion. Incredible stage direction and design gave this romp a cinematic feel. I found Adrianna's &quot;no you din't!&quot; black-girl attitude a little too easy and overdone. (-)(-)Vegas, baby, yeah, yeah!!  Swinging mirrors, and swinging tunes.  (&quot;Falling in love with love is falling in love with Will...&quot;) Again proves that the God of comedy is in the details -- the holy music accompanying the abbess, the nightclub singer's &quot;Thank you!&quot;, the maraca-in surfer boys. Made my smiling muscles hurt.  (-)(-)This separated-at-birth comedy was set in Rat Pack-era Las Vegas, complete with mid-century modern scenic design and costumes and period songs (Falling in Love with Love).  Casting of 2 lead actors in roles of both twins was a great choice and set up a lot of hijinks.  At times hysterically funny, at times totally absurd, this was an inspired interpretation of this play.
14	A Raisin in the Sun	Lorraine Hansberry	Andrea Frye	Bowmer	-1(-)9(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)9(-)-1(-)9(-)-1(-)9	(-)The most moving work of the season  a strong 9. All three leads gave very strong performances, and only the boy Travis detracted from the experience.(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)This story of pipe dreams dropped in favor of family pride was surprisingly relevent, despite it's distance in both time and culture. Strong performances from all (especially Pat Bowie as the strong-willed grandmother) and a solid, simple production made for a great experience. But the greatest strength was in the writing. I was continually suprised every time I thought I had the show figured.(-)(-)(-)(-)
14	Humble Boy	Charlotte Jones	Penny Metropulos	New Theater	-1(-)7(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)7(-)-1(-)7(-)-1(-)-1	(-)A perhaps overly ambitious play, but a very strong script with good laughs throughout. None of the characters is particularly sympathetic. Mercy (a.k.a., the farmer from Chicken Run) delivered a tour de force final speech for her character.  The denouement of the play was somewhat unsatisfying. This play yielded our most interesting conversation at Bloomsbury books coffee shop.(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)I was rather charmed by this fairly straightforward tale of a family under duress. The physics was rather thin and seemed a bit more tangential than I would have liked, but the metaphor of the bees was a little stronger. I'm a little disturbed about a world where men are mere drones, impregnating queens and then living their useless little lives. Come to think of it, I suppose the last moments implied a previously unacknowledged need on the mother's part for the dead father than that.(-)(-)(-)(-)
14	The Royal Family	George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber	Peter Amster	Bowmer	-1(-)5(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)4(-)-1(-)7(-)-1(-)6	(-)Funny, but not a timeless piece, this play tells the story of a particular famous family in the 20s. The set was great. The performances were good, though none particularly outstanding.(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)This play had all the elements of something I should love: wacky hijinks, a nutty family, over the top characters, an unabashed and affectionate argument in favor of acting and the theater, but somehow I just didn't care. I was occassionally amused, but mostly bored. The grandmother's death at the very end was surprisingly touching, given how little I thought I cared.(-)(-)(-)(-)Well-executed and witty, if sometimes slow, production of the Ferber/Kauffman classic.  Second act had the frantic energy I expected, but the third act was a letdown.  Still, excellent performances for the most part, except the uncharacteristically tedious Catherine Lynn Davis.
15	Two Gentlement of Verona	William Shakespeare		Elizabethan	-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)7(-)-1(-)6(-)-1(-)-1	(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)Really charming production of a funny, but somewhat problematic play. The production design and direction were particularly good, and solid performances all around. Nonetheless, I couldn't quite get behind the reconciliation at the end (to a greater degree than in most of these sorts of plays).(-)(-)I only vaguely remember this, and it was last year.  But I do have vague memories of enjoying it.  (-)(-)
15	The Imprtance of Being Earnest	Oscar Wilde	Peter Amster	Bowmer	-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)5(-)-1(-)3(-)-1(-)-1	(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)Great script (obviously), bad dialects, and I didn't like all the vaudeville takes to the audience for the punch lines. Everything seemed overdone, with little flow or relating between the actors. Yes, it's a broad comedy, I just think it needed a lighter touch.(-)(-)Just about everything was wrong with this except what was supplied by Mr. Wilde.(-)(-)

I can't even bring myself to care enough to try to breakdown what was wrong (Falstaff, the dance in the woods, the general incomprehensibility of the first act (ok, that was probably partially the martinis)). The strange thing is I remember really liking it the last time we saw it. (Well, I gave it a six, anyway.)(-)(-)Not so much. (-)(-)

Swashbuckling fun, but with more soul than Three Muskateers. Maybe it's a 10. (Review written in 2007.)(-)(-)(Written in 2007) Yeah, this was great.  The translation with rhymed couplets is amazing, which is impressive when you compare everyone's horrible experience with the Moliere translation this year.

And though she was generally good, there's something distracting in Miraim Laube's (Rosalind's) physicality.(-)(-)Stop with the wooing already.(-)Wrestling with love.(-)
16	The Tempest	William Shakespeare	Libby Appel	Elizabethan	-1(-)-1(-)8(-)-1(-)-1(-)8(-)-1(-)-1(-)7(-)-1(-)8(-)7(-)-1	(-)(-)Beware the Arialettes.(-)(-)(-)Freedom at finale.(-)(-)(-)Well done, but I wasn't really moved. The play feels rather undramatic to me, since Prospero is so in control that there's little doubt about what's going to happen. Derek Lee &quot;The Man Who Loves His Voice&quot; Weeden was good as Prospero, and Miranda (Nell Geisslinger) and Arial (Nancy Rodriguez) were lovely in their roles. I also very much liked the way the Arielettes were handled.(-)(-)Arial's abs. Derek carries it.(-)Strong performances by by the leads.  The King and his crew were the weakest parts, except for the clowns (stephano and trinculo).  Loved Ariel.(-)
17	The Clay Cart	Jab Van Buitnent	Bill Rauch	Bowmer	-1(-)5(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)5(-)-1(-)-1(-)5(-)-1	(-)Fun to see a play from such a different culture.  Great costumes, mediocre singing, pretty good acting.<br />(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)Interesting production, but little tension, for me at least, in this silly, two-thousand year old Indian comedy. It's silliness level, and it's translation reminded me of Comedy of Errors. I wasn't begging for it to end or anything, but I didn't mind when it did. Also, I'm still not really a fan of Miraim Laube, who played Rosalind in last year's As You Like It.(-)(-)(-)I found this production a little disappointing not because I had high expectations for this show, but because I have generally high expectations of all the shows in Ashland.  Though I respect that fact that the show is &quot;ancient&quot; and plays well in that context, it just left me a bit empty.(-)
17	Coriolanus	William Shakespeare	Laird Williamson	New Theatre	-1(-)8(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)8(-)-1(-)8(-)9(-)-1	(-)Very well done, in the New Theater.  Highlight was speedh by Coriolanus's mom, played by Robynn Rodriguez.  She rocks.  I wasn't as bugged as others by the fight scene.(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)Fist throat - yikes. It was really great to see a Shakespeare play and not know what was going to happen (beyond the obvious fact that the tragic anti-hero would die). Fantastic performances from most of the cast. Really the only false part was the big fight between Coriolanus and whatsisname, played by the Enter the Guardsman guy, whom I'm a bit weary of. I was surprised, though perhaps I shouldn't have been, how distinctly undemocratic it was. (-)(-)(-)This was a very pleasant surprise.  As I was reading the director's notes notes in the playbill, I had myself prepared for a long drawn out Shakespearean history/tragedy.  Once the show started though, my whole viewpoint changed.  I was taken in by the story, by the strong performances and the intimate setting of the New Theatre.<br />(-)
17	Our Town	Thorton Wilder	Chay Yew	Elizabethan	-1(-)8(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)8(-)-1(-)6(-)7(-)-1	(-)A solid production of  a classic, if quirky, show.  I admit I cried.  That's what makes it fun.(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)Lovely, simple show. I didn't mind the Emily as much as some, but her accent distracted me a few times, and she certainly was the weak point of the show. The Stage Manager was really charming. (The same actor was also fantastic as one of the over-the-top queens in Hedda 2: Loveborg's Revenge.)(-)(-)I didn't have any problem with Emily's South Asian accent, and it actually brought something new and universal to the show -- it made me consider the possibility that archetypal values of small-town life are likely much the same everywhere, in all cultures.  Despite this, she wasn't able to muster the mixture of adolescent exuberance and tension that the character should convey. I actually thought the actor playing George, however, was the real low point -- he gave very little to the character.  I was surprised, too, that I found the play much less rich than I remembered it from prior viewings.  It may be because of the lackluster performances of the leads, but also may have more to do with me than the production.  Getting old and jaded, I guess. (-)Good clean fun.  Emily was the only weak point for me (and she really wasn't that bad).  (-)
17	View from the Bridge	Arthur Miller	Libby Appel	Bowmer	-1(-)9(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)9(-)-1(-)9(-)9(-)-1	(-)Arthur Miller is awesome. (-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)Great play; great cast. I really liked the way they used the ensemble to create the world, but Eddie, Marco, Katy (the daughter, was that her name? I should really be looking at a program), and the Mother were all amazing. The other principal, Rodolfo, was solid, esp. for an understudy, but not quite up to the level of the other four. The show prompted really the only deep discussion about one of the plays on this trip, largely because of questions about the meaning of the homosexual content. <br /><br />The mother-daughter scene was particularly powerful. Also the chair lifting moment at the end of the first act, though to tell the truth I thought Eddie didn't play his inability to lift the chair quite right. It looked a little fakey to me. Katy's screeching during Rodolfo's singing, was another false moment for some, but I thought she had justified it in the character. <br /><br />I didn't leave quite as pumped up or blown away as I remember from some other shows, which is why it's not quite a 10 for me.(-)(-)Quite moving.  Arthur Miller's script is beautifully economical. Hooray for Libby. (-)Wow!  Libby really got this one right (she's almost always good).  Just amazing performances by Eddie, Bea, and Catherine.  Perfect casting for those three.  Rodolpho is the only reason this isn't a 10 for me.  He was perfectly fine in the role, but stood out relative to the nearly perfect 3 leads.(-)
17	The Further Adventures of Hedda Gabler	Jeff Whitty	Bill Rauch	Bowmer	-1(-)6(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)-1(-)6(-)-1(-)7(-)6(-)6	(-)Funny, but not funny enough.  Required too much inside knowledge of the shows.  And never really got very deep.<br />(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)(-)Frequently hilarious, and a fun concept, but also way over the top. I loved the Medea bits, but it jumped the shark numerous times (Jarjar Binks, Annie), and reminded me just a little too much of Forbidden Broadway and/or SNL. Also, I felt a certain sub-conscious temptation in myself to show off by laughing especially hard at some of the more obscure references, which was annoying.<br /><br />Was the ending a cop-out? I'm not really even sure what I'm supposed to take away from it, other than perhaps a little more respect for aging stereotypes (Mammy, The Boys in the Band, which were both done beautifully). Interesting that those were the two highlighted clich&eacute;s: they're the two &quot;types&quot; that are portrayed in current media as omniscient -- the big black woman, and the long-suffering, gay man.<br />(-)(-)Very pleasant fluff, which I'm all for.  Brings to mind the box-office guy from several years back who called the Merry Wives of Windsor &quot;a Twinkie for the brain.&quot; (-)This show could easily have been a 7, but for a few poor decisions by the author.  I thoroughly enjoyed what he was trying to do, and it was a fun ride, but it didn't rise to the level of Ashland greatness.  The &quot;Grove of Jesus&quot; was great.  Loved Mammy.  Robin as Hedda was perfect.  Lose Annie and JarJar...(-)Some wicked-funny moments and lots of offensive humor, but it felt more than a little self-indulgent (which was probably the point . . .)  It didn't have a lot of enduring resonance with me, and I do think it's the type of play that will be forgotten by the end of this decade.  Like the perky single soccer mom and the junkie girl from Rent, this might become irrelevant shortly after being spit out of the furnace.  Still, it had me in stitches in several parts (including the multiple Jesuses, Tosca, and Icarus).  Dummies falling from the rafters (almost) never get old.
